# 1 Introduction

The previous assignment focused on black box testing, while this assigment is focused on white box. This means we will be looking at the source code and determining the best way to test the functionality. Several techniques will be employed such as branch and statement coverage. This will allow the group to become familiar with white box testing and learn several options for testing code going forward.

- **Objective**: To the case where the theres is more valid rows than matrix.
- **Input**: `data = positive 2D matrix`, `column = 6`, `validRows > data.getRowCount()`.
- **Expected Result**: The method returns `0.0` because the condition `row < rowCount` is false.

| Test Case                          | Execution Path | DU Pairs |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Row outside the bounds of the Data | [1,3,6,7,8,9] |row - (7,9), rowCount- (6,9), total -(3,3)|

![a3-lower bound](https://github.com/BradenTink/SENG-637/assets/69766712/e93650a7-12b3-44bd-af4e-ecd7124a774d)

**Test Case 1: Check for valid lower value**

- **Objective**: Given that a range has a valid lower value.
- **Input**: `valid lower`, `valid upper`
- **Expected Result**: Then, return lower value.

| Test Case | Execution Path | DU Pairs |
| --------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Valid lower value | Bypass `if` [1,2,5] | lower - (2,5), upper - (2,2) |

**Test Case 2: Check for invalid range**

- **Objective**: Given that a range has an invalid lower value.
- **Input**: `lower>upper`, `upper`
- **Expected Result**: Then, the method should error out.

| Test Case | Execution Path | DU Pairs |
| --------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Invalid lower value | Enter `if` [1,2,3,4] | lower - (2,3), upper - (2,3), msg - (3,4) |

**Test Case 3: Check for valid lower value with equal upper value**
- **Objective**: Given that a range has a valid lower value.
- **Input**: `valid lower`, `valid upper` where `lower == upper`
- **Expected Result**: Then, return lower value.

| Test Case | Execution Path | DU Pairs |
| --------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Equal lower and upper value | Bypass `if` [1,2,5] | lower - (2,5), upper - (2,2) |

**Test Case 4: Check for valid lower value with lower and upper being negative**
- **Objective**: Given that a range has a valid lower value.
- **Input**: `valid lower`, `valid upper` where both are negative numbers
- **Expected Result**: Then, return lower value.

| Test Case | Execution Path | DU Pairs |
| --------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Negative lower and upper value | Bypass `if` [1,2,5] | lower - (2,5), upper - (2,2) |

**Test Case 5: Check for invalid range with lower being NaN**
- **Objective**: Given that a range has a NaN lower value.
- **Input**: `lower = NaN`, `valid upper`
- **Expected Result**: Then, the method should error out.

| Test Case | Execution Path | DU Pairs |
| --------- | -------------- | -------- |
| NaN lower value | Bypass `if` [1,2,5] | lower - (2,5), upper - (2,2) |

- For the above case where `lower = NaN`, the method would return the `lower` value which is NaN. This is because the result of comparing `NaN` with any number is always `false`. Thus, the condition `lower > upper`, would evaluate to `false`, and the method would not throw an exception. As a result, the method would proceed to the `return` statement and return the `lower` value, which is `NaN` in this case.

With these 5 cases, they cover `100%` of the method.

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Writing the unit tests was proceeded by first opening up each class and examining the behavior of the class. After opening the class test cases where written by first looking at the methods. Methods were accessed to ensure all branch cases were as well tested.

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

### Test Case 1 Range Equals Method

The Range equals method has three main checks that can be seen below. The equals method is called on an object of type range and is then passed in another object. The first check ensures
that the passed in object is indeed a range object if it it not then method then returns a false. The next two checks are ensuring that both the lower and the upper values of the range are equal. This is done by using the this.upper and this.lower against the passed in objects upper and lower. When all three checks are done and no evaluations are true the statement then returns true.

```java
public boolean contains(double value) {
    if (value < this.lower) {
        return false;
    }
    if (value  > this.upper) {
        return false;
    }
    return (value >= this.lower && value <= this.upper);
}
```

The following four test were written in order to test this method. The first test written declares to objects one being of type range and the next being of type "Double". The equals method was then called this would then hit the first check failing the method. The next two cases are very similar with one having dissimilar lower values then the next having dissimilar upper values. one test declares two range objects of with the same upper value. The final test has two range values with equal upper and lower values which hit the last case of returning true.

```java
@Test
public void testEqualsOfDifObjects() {
	Range objRange = new Range(-5, 5);
	Double d1 = 3.0;
	d1.equals(objRange);
	objRange.equals(d1);
	assertEquals("Check to see if range object is the same Double object should be false", false, objRange.equals(d1));
}
@Test
public void testEqualsOfSameObjects() {
	Range objRange = new Range(-5, 5);
	Range objRange2 = new Range(-4, 5);
	objRange.equals(objRange2);
   	assertEquals("Check to see if two lower bound values are the same should be false", false, objRange.equals(objRange2));
}
@Test
public void testEqualsOfSameObjectsLowerMatching() {
	Range objRange = new Range(-4, 5);
	Range objRange2 = new Range(-4, 4);
	objRange.equals(objRange2);
	assertEquals("Check to see if two lower bound values are the same should be false", false, objRange.equals(objRange2));
}
@Test
public void testEqualsOfSameObjectsSameValues() {
	Range objRange = new Range(-4, 4);
	Range objRange2 = new Range(-4, 4);
	objRange.equals(objRange2);

	assertEquals("Check to see if two lower bound values are the same should be false", true, objRange.equals(objRange2));
}
```

### Test Case 2 Range Constrain Method

The Range Constrain method has three main checks that can be seen in the code snippet below. The method first calls the contains method to check the given value is within the specified range object. If the value is contained inside the range it then moves to the return statement at the bottom of the method. If this test fails then the next two checks can begin where the value is compared against the lower and upper value of the range. If value is above the upper than the upper value is returned. If the value is below the lower than the lower value is returned.

```java
public double constrain(double value) {
    double result = value;
    if (!contains(value)) {
        if (value > this.upper) {
            result = this.upper;
        }
        else if (value < this.lower) {
            result = this.lower;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

The following three tests were written in order to test the three checks where the value was either above or below or inside the range. The test either expect to see the constrained upper or lower value of the range seen in the first two test cases. While the last test case expects to see the given value returned as it fail inside the Range objects constraints.

```java
 @Test
public void testAboveConstrain() { //Any value above 1 should be constrained to 1
    assertEquals("A value above the range should be constrained to 1", 1, exampleRange.constrain(2), 0.000000001d);
}

@Test
public void testBelowConstrain() { //Any value below -1 should be constrained to -1
    assertEquals("A value below the range should be constrained to -1", -1, exampleRange.constrain(-2), 0.000000001d);
}

@Test
public void testInsideConstrain() { //Checking nominal value inside the boundary range
    assertEquals("A value inside the range should give itself", 0, exampleRange.constrain(0), 0.000000001d);
}
```

### Test Case 3 Range Hashcode Method

The Range hashCode method is a fairly simple linear method that returns the hashcode for the range, and doesn't require any parameters.

```java
public int hashCode() {
        int result;
        long temp;
        temp = Double.doubleToLongBits(this.lower);
        result = (int) (temp ^ (temp >>> 32));
        temp = Double.doubleToLongBits(this.upper);
        result = 29 * result + (int) (temp ^ (temp >>> 32));
        return result;
    }
```

The following test was written to call the hascode method. Since there is only one path through the method, only one call was required.

```java
@Test
public void testHashCode() {
   assertEquals("Return Hashcode.",
      -31457280, exampleRange.hashCode());
}
```

### Test Case 4: Range getLowerBound Method

For achieving comprehensive testing coverage of the `getLowerBound` method, it's essential to work with a valid `Range` object. Due to the constructor's design, situations where `lower` exceeds `upper` are preemptively blocked, rendering it impossible to test within the `getLowerBound` method itself. This ensures that an invalid range cannot be instantiated, as illustrated in the constructor:

```java
    public Range(double lower, double upper) {
        if (lower > upper) {
            String msg = "Range(double, double): requires lower (" + lower
                + ") <= upper (" + upper + ").";
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(msg);
        }
        this.lower = lower;
        this.upper = upper;
    }

    public double getLowerBound() {
        if (lower > upper) {
            String msg = "Range(double, double): require lower (" + lower + ") <= upper (" + upper + ").";
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(msg);
        }
        return this.lower;
    }
```

### Test Case 5: DataUtilities calculateColumnTotal Method

Testing coverage for `DataUtilities.getColumnTotal()` was achieved by considering good, bad, and null inputs for the three parameters: `data`, `column`, and `validRows`. For `data`, valid or null inputs were considered. For `validRows`, the possibilities included null, no data, or valid in the array.

| Method                                            | Good Input | Bad Input      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| calculateColumnTotal(Values2D, column)            | any double | null           |
| calculateColumnTotal(Values2D, column, validRows) | any double | null, no input |

**Note**: Testing for other edge cases for `validRows`, such as negative values or a null input, **does not** make sense as the purpose is to test the method's coverage.

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

The tool used for code coverage was EclEmma as recommended. This tool was helpful in highlighting the lines of code that were run, and how many branches were tested at each decision point.

EclEmma Pros:

- Works cleanly and clearly with Eclipse, and does not take much time to set up
- Highlights the statements that have been run
- Provides a clear report of the results

EclEmma Cons:

- Only shows the number of branches tested at a decisoin point, not which ones were tested
- Condition coverage percentage is not included in report

Statement Coverage Pros:

- By providing the percentage of statements you can determine how much of the code was run
- Simple metric that is easy to convey

Statement Coverage Cons:

- Some code might be unreachable, deflating the score
- Testing every line might be unnecessary

Branch Coverage Pros:

- Covers all the possible decision paths
- Less time consuming as other metrics

Branch Coverage Cons:

- Not every line is tested (could have errors elsewhere)
- Some testing might be redundant

Method Coverage Pros:

- Shows if any methods were missed
- Easier to hit 100%

Method Coverage Cons:

- Could miss errors in methods even if they are tested

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

Requirements-Based Advantages:
-Focuses on the purpose rather than the execution
-Don't need to be as familiar with the source code
-Usually require fewer tests
-More similar to how a user would find errors

Requirements-Based Disadvantages:
-Don't see what is happening in the code
-Could miss errors that would be seen in a code review
-Don't know if every scenario is tested for

Coverage-Based Advantages:
-Focuses on execution rather than purpose
-Programming errors are more easy to catch
-Every line and branch can be tested

Coverage-Based Disadvantages:
-More knowledge of coding required
-Often more time required
-Required metrics might be difficult to hit depending on code

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

The assignment was split between the group members so that everyone was able to get experience with the tools. Some members focused on the hand calculations, while others focused on the code, but all members did some of each. This allowed for all to become familiar with the white box testing techniques.

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

There were some issues with getting the sufficient code coverage required of 'Range'. This was mostly due to the checks in place to ensure the upper value was above the lower value. Since the creation of the Range object required this to be true, the inside of the check was never entered.

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

It was interesting to implement the white box testing. If some of the checks in Range were removed so that the code coverage could be incresed to the required amounts, that would reduce some confusion.
